INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


I. Getting and installing Java

Titokone is a TTK-91 machine language simulator written in Java. To
run Titokone, you need a Java virtual machine (minimum version 1.4.2)
installed. You can download an implementation of the Java virtual
machine at http://java.sun.com. Follow their installation instructions.

It may be slightly difficult to find what you want at Sun's Java
pages. To install just the virtual machine, look for "JRE", to install
the development environment as well for making your own Java programs
or for creating new translations for Titokone, look for "SDK". At the
time of writing this, J2SE version 1.4.2, both SDK and JRE (the 2 is
the platform number, version number is different) could be downloaded
from http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html. 
 
Note that on the University of Helsinki, CS department, Java SDK 1.4.2
or newer has been installed already, so you only need to install Java
if you want to use Titokone at eg. your home machine.


II. Getting Titokone

You can get Titokone via the Tietokoneen toiminta (Computer Organization) 
course homepage, currently at http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/teemu.kerola/tito/.
You can choose between downloading the JAR package containing Titokone
(titokone.jar) directly or downloading a ZIP file which contains the
JAR file itself along with some instructions and helper programs.


III. Installing Titokone


1) Quick installation (Windows, Linux, etc)

For those who know how to manage JAR packages directly, fetching
titokone.jar is sufficient. (JAR is a package
format; if you have an up-to-date version of WinZip, you should be
able to open them) No installation is required; you can run the jar
file directly. For example, in Windows you must execute the command 

  java.exe -jar titokone.jar 

in the directory where you stored the titokone.jar package. 
In Linux, you must execute the command

  java -jar titokone.jar 

to run the program. You must have Java installed and on your execution
path. 


2) Almost-as-quick installation in Windows

Download titokone.zip and unpack it to the target directory of your
choosing. (The package creates a subdirectory called 'titokone'.) To
run Titokone, go to the subdirectory and double-click on the titokone
BAT (MS-DOS Batch) file. You can tell titokone.bat apart from the
titokone.jar file by its icon; titokone.jar usually looks like
something yellow in a screw bench, titokone.bat resembles a cog wheel
inside a window frame. Titokone.sh, a script which starts the program
in Linux, is probably an unknown filetype in Windows.

If BAT files have stopped working in Windows MEGAMILLIONSUPER (we have
tested them up to Windows XP), you can probably still somehow run the
command 'java.exe -jar C:\my\path\to\titokone\titokone.jar' via the
Start menu. Replace C:\my\path\to\titokone with the actual path to the
file.


3) Almost-as-quick installation in Linux

Download titokone.zip and unpack it (eg. gunzip titokone.zip) to the
target directory of your choosing. (The package creates a subdirectory
called 'titokone'.)  To run titokone, open a terminal, change to the
directory you unpacked the zip file in and run 
  java -jar titokone.jar

If typing is tiresome, the zip contains a titokone.sh startup script
for your convenience. It is called titokone.sh, which you can rename
to something shorter, like tk. Then you just need to run ./tk
(or ./titokone.sh if you have not renamed it). 


4) Opening the jar (mostly interesting for developers only)

If you wish, you can open the jar by running the following command:
  in Windows: It is probably easiest to open the file using WinZip or
              something similar.
  in Linux: jar -xvf titokone.jar

The jar package contains the source code and class files. If you
modify the files, eg. to add a new language file (see the included
manual on how to do this), you should note that the class files are
a part of a package (three packages, to be exact).

To start the modified program, change to the package root directory (where
the 'fi' subdirectory is located) and run the command:
  in Windows: java.exe fi.hu.cs.titokone.Titokone 
  in Linux: java fi.hu.cs.titokone.Titokone

Javadoc of the classes is included in javadoc/. To compile files
(needed for eg. adding new language support), you need Java SDK, JRE
is not sufficient.
